                                           <p> For this project I decided to try to create a website from scratch rather than using a template, or another site that creates the website for you. I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do and began some online lessons. After this I looked for a site to create a domain and begin hosting my website. This process was quite tedious and I had to go through multiple articles, along with multiple sites, due to the fact that most of these where <em> Wix, </em> or <em> GoogleSites-esque </em>webpages. Once I found a webpage that I could create my own domain name in, and add in my own code, I waited for it register said site, and began typing up the base code I needed. </p>
                                           
                                           
                                           <script src="javascript/app.js"></script>
</body> 
                                                                          </html>
